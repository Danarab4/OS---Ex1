EX: 1

FILES:
osm.cpp -- a code to measure time of different operations. This code would run on VM, container and
the CS computers.
measurements.png -- a graph representing the results of the measurements from the different devices.


REMARKS:
As we expected, the code run fastest on the CS computers, afterwards on the container and finally on
the VM. Furthermore, the fastest operation was the addition, then the empty function call and last
the sysCall.



ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
-------------
The program accepts one argument and creates the directories "Welcome" and "Welcome/To" with the
permissions 0775: read, write and execute to the User and the Group and only read and execute
permissions to Other.
Afterwards the program creates a new file in the "Welcome/To" directory called
"OS2020" with write-only permissions and using the 666 flag that grants read and write permissions
to everyone (User, Group and Other).
Then, the program checks OS2020's status using the "fstat" command and writes to the file:
"<username>\nIf you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n<arguement>",
where <argument> is the argument given to the program and <username> is the cs-user's name.
Finally, the program closes the file, releases it's handle and tries to delete it (using the
unlink command) and deletes the directories it have created.
