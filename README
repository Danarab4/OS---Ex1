ANSWERS:

Assignment 1:
The program accepts one argument and creates the directories "Welcome" and "Welcome/To" with the
permissions 0775: read, write and execute to the User and the Group and only read and execute
permissions to Other. Afterwards the program creates a new file in the "Welcome/To" directory called
"OS2020" with write-only permissions and using the 666 flag, grants read and write permissions to
everyone.
Then, the program checks OS2020's status using the "fstat" command. Then, it writes :
"If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!\n<arguement>", where <argument>
is the argument given to the program.
Finally, the program closes the file, releases it's handle and tries to delete it (using the
unlink command) and deletes the directories it have created.
